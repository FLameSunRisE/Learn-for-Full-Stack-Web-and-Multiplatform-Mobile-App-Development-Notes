##  The Model View Controller Framework

*  Design Patterns
  *  Well-documented solution to a recurring problem

*  The Model-View-Controller \(MVC\) Framework
  *  Define

    *  Isolation of domain logic from user interface

    * Permits independent development, testing and maintenance \(separation of concerns\)

  * Model

    * manages the behavior and data of the application domain

    * responds to requests for information about its state \(usually from the view\) 

    * responds to instructions to change state \(usually from the controller\) 

  * View

    *  renders the model into a form suitable for interaction, typically a user interface element 

    * Multiple views can exist for a single model for different purposes 

    * A viewport typically has a one to one correspondence with a display surface and knows how to render to it

  * Controller

    * receives user input and initiates a response by making calls on model objects 

    * A controller accepts input from the user and instructs the model and viewport to perform actions based on that input
