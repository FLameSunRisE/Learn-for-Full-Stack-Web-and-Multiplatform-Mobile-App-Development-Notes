*  Software Library

  *  Collection of implementations of behavior with a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked

  * Modularity

*  Software Framework

  *  Abstraction in which software provides generic functionality that can be selectively changed by additional user-written code

  *  Universal, reusable environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform

* ** Library vs Framework**

  *  Library 

    * a collection of functions which are useful when writing web apps. Your code is in charge and it calls into the library when it sees fit. 

    * E.g., jQuery. 

  * Frameworks

    * a particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in the details. The framework is in charge and it calls into your code when it needs something app specific. 

    * E.g., Angular, Ember, etc
